        <p><em>Homemade Japanese salted salmon (塩鮭 Shiozake) with crispy skin. This is a really straightforward recipe. Enjoy the flavorful salmon in rice balls, bento, or as a wholesome accompaniment to traditional Japanese breakfast.</em></p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1.1 lbs <strong>skin-on salmon fillet</strong> (&frac12 inch thickness)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons <strong>kosher or sea salt (Use half for table salt)</strong> (5% of salmon weight; 5% of 500 g is 25g. 1 teaspoon kosher/sea salt is around 3-5 g)</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h5>To Prepare</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Quickly rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Slice the salmon diagonally if it’s not pre-sliced.</li>
            <li>Evenly distribute sake on the salmon and coat well. Set aside for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, pat dry the salmon with a paper towel and sprinkle salt on the skin and both sides of the fillets.</li>
            <li>Place in a sealed container wrapped in paper towel and let sit for 2 days to remove moisture.</li>
            <li>Gently pat dry the fillets with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>To Broil</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the broiler with a rack placed around 6" (15 cm) away from the top heating element. When broiling, you don't control the temperature in the oven; instead, you <strong>control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food</strong></li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleaning. Place the salmon on the foil, skin side up (for crispy skin!).</li>
            <li>Broil the salmon at <strong>Medium</strong> (500&degF/260&degC) or <strong>High</strong> (550&degF/288&degC) for 8-10 minutes. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish and the distance between the broiler and the food. Japanese salted salmon is cooked till well done (more dry and flaky).</li>
